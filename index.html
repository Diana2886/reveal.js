						<h2>TypeScript Overview</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							TypeScript is an open-source, object-oriented language developed and maintained by Microsoft.
							<br>TypeScript extends JavaScript by adding data types, classes, and other object-oriented features with type-checking.
							<br>It is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

						<h3>Why TypeScript?</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							So, why should we use TypeScript?
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>JavaScript is a dynamic programming language with <u>no type system</u></p>
						<aside class="notes">
							JavaScript is a dynamic programming language with no type system.
							JavaScript provides primitive types like string, number, object, etc., but it doesn't check assigned values.
							JavaScript variables can point to any value.
							So, without the type system, it is not easy to use JavaScript to build complex applications with large teams working on the same code.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>The type system increases the code quality, readability</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-in">Errors can be caught at compile</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-in">TypeScript supports object-oriented programming features</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							The type system increases the code quality, readability and makes it easy to maintain and refactor codebase.
							<br>--More importantly, errors can be caught at compile time rather than at runtime.
							<br>So, the reason to use TypeScript is that it catches errors at compile-time, so that you can fix it before you run code.
							<br>--It supports object-oriented programming features like data types, classes, enums, etc., allowing JavaScript to be used at scale.

							<li class="fragment fade-in">Some of the most popular JavaScript frameworks are written in TypeScript</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							TypeScript compiles into simple JavaScript.
							<br>--The TypeScript compiler is also implemented in TypeScript and can be used with any browser or JavaScript engines like Node.js.
							TypeScript needs an ECMAScript 3 or higher compatible environment to compile. This is a condition met by all major browsers and JavaScript engines today.
							<br>--Some of the most popular JavaScript frameworks like Angular and Vue.js are written in TypeScript.

						<h3>How to use TypeScript?</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							TypeScript code is written in a file with .ts extension and then compiled into JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>A TypeScript file can be written in any code editor</p>
						<p>Many text editors and development environments have TypeScript support at the plugin level</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							A TypeScript file can be written in any code editor.
							Many text editors and development environments, such as Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime, WebStorm, and others,
							have TypeScript support at the plugin level, which allows you to take advantage of a number of benefits,
							such as code highlighting or tooltip on types and constructs language.

						<img src="./examples/assets/typescript-workflow.png" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							A TypeScript compiler needs to be installed on your platform. 
							It can be installed using the npm package manager command that is used in Node.js:
							<br>the command is - npm install -g typescript
							<br>Once installed, the command tsc &lt;filename&gt;.ts compiles the TypeScript code into a plain JavaScript file.
							JavaScript files can then be included in the HTML and run on any browser.

						<h3>TypeScript Features</h3>

						<ul>
							<li class="fragment fade-in">Cross-Platform</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-in">Object-Oriented Language</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-in">Static type-checking</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-in">Optional Static Typing</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-in">DOM Manipulation</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-in">ES 6 Features</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							--Cross-Platform: TypeScript runs on any platform that JavaScript runs on.
							The TypeScript compiler can be installed on any Operating System such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.
							<br>--Object-Oriented Language: TypeScript provides powerful features such as Classes, Interfaces, and Modules.
							You can write pure object-oriented code for client-side as well as server-side development.
							<br>--Static type-checking: TypeScript uses static typing. This is done using type annotations.
							It helps type checking at compile time. So, you can find errors while typing the code without running your script each time.
							Also, if a variable is declared without a type, it will have a type based on its value.
							<br>--Optional Static Typing: TypeScript static typing is optional, if you prefer to use JavaScript's dynamic typing.
							<br>--DOM Manipulation: Like JavaScript, TypeScript can be used to manipulate the Document object model.
							<br>--ES 6 Features: TypeScript includes most features of ECMAScript 2015 such as class, interface, Arrow functions etc.

						<h3>TypeScript Advantages</h3>

					<section>
						<p><span style="color: #42affa;">TypeScript</span>:</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment fade-in">is an open-source language</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-in">runs on any browser or JavaScript engine</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-in">is similar to JavaScript and uses the same syntax and semantics</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-in">is closer in syntax to backend languages</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-in">can be called from an existing JavaScript code</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							--TypeScript is an open-source language with continuous development and maintenance by Microsoft.
							<br>--TypeScript runs on any browser or JavaScript engine.
							<br>--TypeScript is similar to JavaScript and uses the same syntax and semantics.
							All of TypeScript's code finally gets converted into JavaScript.
							That's why front-end developers who currently write code in JavaScript can quickly learn this language.
							<br>--TypeScript is also closer in syntax to backend languages like Java and Scala. This helps backend developers write front-end code faster.
							<br>--TypeScript code can be called from an existing JavaScript code.
							TypeScript also works with existing JavaScript frameworks and libraries without any issues.
